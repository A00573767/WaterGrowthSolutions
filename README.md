# WaterGrowthSolutions
Our project focuses on the development of an accessible and economical vertical or drip irrigation system, specially designed for the rural areas most affected by water scarcity. This system not only addresses the described issue but also tackles the existing global need to establish practical and compact spaces for effective agricultural production, implementing renewable energies, facilitating the equitable allocation of resources, long-term planning of their use, and establishing accessible manufacturing for anyone.
As it is a system that requires little energy, it is feasible to create a homemade solar panel capable of supplying enough power to make it autonomous, maintaining a constant energy source, considering that the focus is primarily on rural areas of Mexico; many of them without a fixed supply. Likewise, we highlight the aspect of accessibility, being a supporting foundation, because drip gardens are not new, however, providing an accessible option for anyone, with variable resources and a support network through this website, expands a panorama of new opportunities towards vulnerable areas.
Even by providing the assembly and shipping service of the product, we address the issue of space within the agricultural sector because its limitation leads to deforestation and the destruction of ecosystems. By implementing the vertical garden, WaterGrowth Solutions (WGS) manages to cultivate abundance and sow hope.
